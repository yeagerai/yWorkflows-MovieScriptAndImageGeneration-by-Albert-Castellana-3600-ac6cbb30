# MovieScriptAndImageGeneration

This workflow takes a user input, generates a movie script using GPT-4, and creates a visual image about the script using DALL-E. It consists of three components: UserInput, GPT4ScriptGenerator, and DALL-EImageGenerator. The UserInput Component receives the initial user input (a theme or idea for the movie), the GPT4ScriptGenerator generates a movie script based on this input, and the DALL-EImageGenerator creates an image representation of the script. The workflow uses OpenAI's GPT-4 and DALL-E APIs to generate the script and image respectively, as follows: 1. Accepts the user input in a text format. 2. Passes the input to the GPT4ScriptGenerator, which generates a movie script using GPT-4 API. 3. Passes the generated script to the DALL-EImageGenerator, which creates an image representation of the script
   using DALL-E API.
4. Returns the generated movie script and its image representation as the final output.

## Initial generation prompt
