# Component Name
MovieScriptAndImageGeneration

# Description
The MovieScriptAndImageGeneration component is designed to generate movie scripts and images based on a given theme text. This component is a part of a Yeager Workflow.

# Input and Output Models
The component uses three data models.

1. **UserInputModel**: The input model for this component, which consists of a `theme_text` field.
    - `theme_text` (str): The theme text for generating the movie script and image.

2. **ScriptOutputModel**: The output model containing the generated movie script based on the theme text.
    - `theme_text` (str): The input theme text.
    - `script_text` (str): The generated movie script.

3. **ImageOutputModel**: The output model containing the generated image based on the theme text and script.
    - `theme_text` (str): The input theme text.
    - `script_text` (str): The generated movie script.
    - `image_url` (str): The URL of the generated image.

# Parameters
The component has one parameter:

- `args` (UserInputModel): The input data model containing the `theme_text`.

# Transform Function
The `transform()` function performs the following steps:

1. Calls the `transform()` method of the parent class (AbstractWorkflow).
2. Populates the `ScriptOutputModel` with the input `theme_text` and `script_text` generated by the parent class `transform()` method.
3. Populates the `ImageOutputModel` with the input `theme_text`, `script_text`, and the `image_url` generated by the parent class `transform()` method.
4. Returns the output models as a dictionary.

# External Dependencies
There are four external dependencies used by this component:

1. `typing`: For type hinting purposes.
2. `dotenv`: To load environment variables from a `.env` file.
3. `fastapi`: To create the FastAPI app and POST route for the `/transform` endpoint.
4. `pydantic`: For creating data models (UserInputModel, ScriptOutputModel, and ImageOutputModel) and their automatic validation and serialization.

# API Calls
There are no direct API calls made in this component. However, depending on the implementation details of the parent class `AbstractWorkflow` and the Yeager Workflow, the transform() function might involve API calls to generate the movie script and image.

# Error Handling
The component primarily relies on Pydantic for error handling. The Pydantic data models automatically validate the input and output data. If the data does not match the expected format, Pydantic will raise a ValidationError with a detailed error message.

# Examples
Below is an example of how to set up and use the MovieScriptAndImageGeneration component within a Yeager Workflow.
