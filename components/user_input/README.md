# Component Name

UserInput

## Description

The UserInput component is a simple building block in a Yeager Workflow that stores user input text and returns it as output. It is designed to perform the basic function of receiving and returning user input within a workflow. This component is a Python class that inherits from the AbstractComponent base class.

## Input and Output Models

The component has two input/output models:

### Input Model: UserInputModel

This model includes:

- `user_text`: A string representing the user's input text.

### Output Model: UserInputOutputDict

This model includes:

- `stored_text`: A string representing the stored user input text.

The input and output models use `pydantic` for validation and serialization.

## Parameters

The UserInput component does not have any additional parameters aside from the ones defined in the input model.

## Transform Function

The transform() method in the UserInput component works as follows:

1. Receive the input arguments `args`, which should be an instance of the `UserInputModel`.
2. Store the user input text in the `stored_text` variable.
3. Return an instance of the `UserInputOutputDict` with the stored text.

## External Dependencies

The following external libraries are used by the component:

- `pydantic`: Used for defining the input and output data models, as well as validation and serialization.
- `dotenv`: Used for loading environment variables.
- `fastapi`: Used for creating a FastAPI application to expose the component's functionality as an API.

## API Calls

The component does not make any external API calls.

## Error Handling

Currently, the component does not handle errors explicitly. However, any errors that could arise during the validation of input or output data (using `pydantic`) will automatically be handled by FastAPI.

## Examples

Here's an example of how to use the UserInput component within a Yeager Workflow:
