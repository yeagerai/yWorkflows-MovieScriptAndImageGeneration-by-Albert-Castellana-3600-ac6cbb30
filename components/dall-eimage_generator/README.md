# Component Name
DALLEImageGenerator

# Description
The DALLEImageGenerator is a Yeager component responsible for generating images based on input text by calling the DALL-E API. This component takes in script_text and theme_text as input, and produces an image_url as output, along with the input data.

# Input and Output Models
## Input Model
- `DALLEImageGeneratorInputDict`:
    - `script_text` (str): The input text to generate the image.
    - `theme_text` (str): Additional text related to the theme of the image.
  
## Output Model
- `DALLEImageGeneratorOutputDict`:
    - `image_url` (str): The URL of the generated image.
    - `theme_text` (str): The input theme_text passed unchanged.
    - `script_text` (str): The input script_text passed unchanged.

# Parameters
The component does not have parameters beyond the input model 'DALLEImageGeneratorInputDict', required by the `transform()` method.

# Transform Function
The `transform()` method performs the following steps:
1. Print a message that the component is executing its transform.
2. Prepare the API headers and data for the DALL-E API call:
    - Use the 'DALLE_API_KEY' and 'DALLE_API_URL' from the environment variables.
3. Make a POST request to the DALL-E API with the input 'script_text'.
4. Parse the response and extract the 'image_url' from the API's response.
5. Create a DALLEImageGeneratorOutputDict containing 'image_url', 'theme_text', and 'script_text'.
6. Return the output.

# External Dependencies
The following external libraries are used by the component:

- `os`: To access environment variables.
- `typing.Optional`: For type hinting.
- `yaml`: For loading environment configuration files.
- `dotenv`: For loading environment variable files.
- `fastapi`: For creating the FastAPI application.
- `pydantic`: For creating the input and output models with validation.
- `requests`: For making the POST request to the API.

# API Calls
The component makes a single API call to the DALL-E API to generate an image based on the input 'script_text'. The API key and the API URL are fetched from the environment variables 'DALLE_API_KEY' and 'DALLE_API_URL', respectively.

# Error Handling
The component does not have specific error handling at this stage, so unhandled exceptions will propagate up to the caller. However, `Pydantic` is used for validating input and output data types, which provides some level of error protection.

# Examples
To use this component within a Yeager Workflow, create a 'DALLEImageGenerator' instance and call the 'transform' method with the required 'DALLEImageGeneratorInputDict' input argument:
